\section{Biosketch}
\noindent PI Srinivasa is the Boeing Endowed Professor at The Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science \& Engineering at the University of Washington, and an IEEE Fellow for contributions to robotic manipulation and human-robot interaction. He is a full-stack roboticist, with the goal of enabling robots to perform complex manipulation tasks under uncertainty and clutter, with and around people. To this end, he founded the Personal Robotics Lab in 2005. He is/was a PI on the Quality of Life Technologies NSF ERC, RCTA, DARPA ARM-S, DARPA RACER, and the DARPA Robotics Challenge, has built several robots (HERB, ADA, CHIMP, MuSHR), and has written software frameworks (OpenRAVE, DART) and best-paper award winning algorithms (CBiRRT, CHOMP, BIT*, Legibility, LazySP) used extensively by roboticists around the world. Srinivasa received a B.Tech in Mechanical Engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology Madras in 1999, and a PhD in 2005 from the Robotics Institute at Carnegie Mellon University.

\section{Qualifications}
The PI has significant experience related to the proposed project including the following select projects:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{ONR SquadBot.} In this ONR-sponsored project, IHMC is developing the Nadia humanoid robot, and creating a “SquadBot” system, a humanoid robot system that demonstrates the potential of robots operating as part of a squad in urban operations, with the focus on building search. PI Srinivasa has contributes motion planning, grasping, and perception algorithms to the project. Work in this project will leverage the SquadBot platform as a potential demonstrator of the learning algorithms developed.
    \item \textbf{DARPA RACER (Aggressive, Resilient, High-speed Navigation in Off-road Terrain).} PI Srinivasa’s team at UW has been developing a framework for fluent motion planning for high-speed off-road navigation, integrating components such as fast replanning, contingency planning, and learning from experience.
    \item \textbf{DARPA Robotics Challenge (DRC).} PI Srinivasa was a lead PI of the the Carnegie Mellon UNiversity (CMU) team which built CHIMP, a four-limbed robot  which finished third in the overall challenge. PI Srinivasa was responsible for the motion planning, grasping, and manipulation stack of the robot.
    \item \textbf{DARPA Autonomous Robotic Manipulation - Software (ARM-S).} PI Srinivasa was a lead PI of the Carnegie Mellon University team which won the DARPA ARM-S challenge, a series of complex physical manipulation tasks including door opening, drilling, and changing the tyre of a car using an autonomous bimanual manipulator. PI Srinivasa's algorithms for the motion planning , manipulation, control, and shared autonomy were deployed on the robot.
    \item \textbf{Army Research Laboratory’s Robotics Collaborative Technology Alliance (RCTA).} PI Srinivasa’s UW team worked with NASA/JPL’s ROMAN platform, developing a motion planning stack for mobile manipulation. The team demonstrated the efficacy of their framework across a series of challenging real-world manipulation tasks including clearing debris on rough outdoor terrain.
